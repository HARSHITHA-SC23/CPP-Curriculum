### Programs on Data Types, Operators, Strings, Math, Booleans

1. WAP to get input from the user as "Give the value for Data Type name:" (Fetch for every datatyoes) and print as "Data type name: value given by the user".
2. WAP 
    - fetch two values from user say X and Y.
    - Perform Arithmetic operations on the two values given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'arithmetic operation name' is:" value.
3. WAP 
    - fetch a value from user say X.
    - Perform Assignment operations on the values given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'Assignment operation name' is:" value.
4. WAP 
    - fetch two values from user say X and Y.
    - Perform Comparission operations on the two values given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'Comparission operation name' is:" value.
5. WAP 
    - fetch a value from user say X.
    - Perform Logical operations on the value given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'Logical operation name' is:" value.
6. WAP to create a string variable fetch the value from the user and print on the screen as output
7. WAP to perform concatenate first name and last name of the user. The value to be obtained as input(No hardcode value).
8. WAP
    - Get the string input from the user and print the total number of letter in string 
    - using all the possible string method to calculate the total count.
9. WAP
    - Get the string from the user as input
    - Output the letter which is in 4th position.
    - Replace the 4th position character with "*". and output the result.
10. WAP to Out this sentences without any error
    - "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
    - "It's alright."
    - "The character \ is called backslash."
11. WAP using library
    - Find the maximum between 118967,567853
    - Find the minimum between -7897,-5678
    - Find the square root of 789654 and square of 456
    - Find the value for 786 to the power of 7
    - Find the rounded down value for 456.2345
    - Find the rounded up value for 4536.876
    - convert this number to positive integer -56
    - Find the highest floating number between 898.735, 898.768
    - Find the lowest floating number between 56.8797,56.78964

### Programs n conditions

12. WAP to find maximum between two numbers. (using if statement only)
13. WAP to find maximum between two numbers. (Using if else statement)
14. WAP to find maximum between three numbers.
15. WAP to check whether a given number -ve,+ve or 0.
16. WAP to check whether a number is divisible by both 5 and 11.
17. WAP to check whether a number is even or odd.
18. WAP to check whether a year is leap year or not.
    Logic: The year is a leap year is
        - The year is multiple of 400. 
        - The year is multiple of 4 and not multiple of 100.
19. WAP to check whether a character is alphabet or not.
20. WAP to check whether an alphabet is vowel or consonent.
21. WAP to check whether a character is alphabet, number or a special character.
22. WAP to check whether a character is uppercase or lowercase.
23. WAP to print week day by taking week number as an input.
    example: 1 is monday and so on.
24. WAP to print number of days in a month and name of the month by taking month number as an input.
25. WAP to print total number of notes in a give currency 
    example: 575 rupees has
        - 500: 1
        - 100: 0
        - 50: 1
        - 20: 1
        - 10: 0
        - 5: 1
        - 2: 0
        - 1: 0
