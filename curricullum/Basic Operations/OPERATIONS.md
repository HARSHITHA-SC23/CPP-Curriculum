##Practice Program to execute in the Online C++ compiler

1. WAP to get input from the user as "Give the value for Data Type name:" (Fetch for every datatyoes) and print as "Data type name: value given by the user".
2. WAP 
    - fetch two values from user say X and Y.
    - Perform Arithmetic operations on the two values given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'arithmetic operation name' is:" value.
3. WAP 
    - fetch a value from user say X.
    - Perform Assignment operations on the values given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'Assignment operation name' is:" value.
4. WAP 
    - fetch two values from user say X and Y.
    - Perform Comparission operations on the two values given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'Comparission operation name' is:" value.
5. WAP 
    - fetch a value from user say X.
    - Perform Logical operations on the value given by the user
    - Display the output as " The 'Logical operation name' is:" value.
6. WAP to create a string variable fetch the value from the user and print on the screen as output
7. WAP to perform concatenate first name and last name of the user. The value to be obtained as input(No hardcode value).
